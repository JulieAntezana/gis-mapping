Repository for GIS Mapping project

# Overview

I am creating a GIS Mapping project to further my learning as a software engineer.

This software is a map of the area surrounding Victoria, British Columbia in Canada. It has several points of interest that can be clicked to get further information.

My purpose for writing this software was to prepare for my own upcoming vacation. I hope it will help others who may be planning to travel to the Victoria/Vancouver area.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
